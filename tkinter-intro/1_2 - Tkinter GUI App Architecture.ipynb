    "- The little window objects can be text labels, buttons, list boxes, etc., and these individual little GUI components are known as Widgets.\n",
    "\n",

    "- The object that is returned by making a call to tkinter.Tk() is usually referred to as the Root Window.\n",

    "- Top-level windows are mainly stand-alone as part of your application, also you can have more than one top-level window for your GUI, but only one of them should be your root window.\n",

If you will move the mouse to another part of your application, something has to cause the movement of the mouse to be replicated by the cursor on your screen(on top of your GUI application). These are 'cursor move' events that the system must process to portray your cursor moving across the window. At the time you will stop moving the mouse, no more events need to be processed, so everything just stays still on the screen again."
