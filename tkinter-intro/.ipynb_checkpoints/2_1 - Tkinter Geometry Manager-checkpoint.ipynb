    "\n",
    "The pack() method mainly uses a **packing algorithm** in order to place widgets in a Frame or window in a specified order.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is mainly used to **organize the widgets in a block**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Packing Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps of Packing algorithm are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Firstly this algorithm will compute a rectangular area known as a Parcel which is tall (or wide) enough to hold the widget and then it will fill the remaining width (or height) in the window with blank space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It will center the widget until any different location is specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is powerful but it is difficult to visualize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the syntax for using pack() function:\n",
    "        \n",
    "       widget.pack(options)  \n",
    "The possible options as a parameter to this method are given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **fill**\n",
    "    The default value of this option is set to NONE. Also, we can set it to X or Y in order to determine whether the widget contains any extra space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **side**\n",
    "    This option specifies which side to pack the widget against. If you want to pack widgets vertically, use TOP which is the default value. If you want to pack widgets horizontally, use LEFT.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **expand**\n",
    "    This option is used to specify whether the widgets should be expanded to fill any extra space in the geometry master or not. Its default value is false. If it is false then the widget is not expanded otherwise widget expands to fill extra space."
