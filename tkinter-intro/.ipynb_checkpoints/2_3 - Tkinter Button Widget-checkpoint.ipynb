    "| :----------- | :----------- |\n",
    "| activeground| This option indicates the background [**color**](https://anzeljg.github.io/rin2/book2/2405/docs/tkinter/colors.html) of the button at the time **when the mouse hovers the button.** |\n",
    "| activeforeground | This option mainly represents the font [**color**](https://anzeljg.github.io/rin2/book2/2405/docs/tkinter/colors.html) of the button when the mouse hovers the button.|\n",
    "| anchor | Where the text is positioned on the button. See [**Section 5.5, “Anchors”**](https://anzeljg.github.io/rin2/book2/2405/docs/tkinter/anchors.html). For example, anchor=tk.NE would position the text at the top right corner of the button. The **default value is CENTER** which is used to align the text in center in the provided space. |\n",
    "| bd | This option is used for the **border width** of the widget. See [**Section 5.1, “Dimensions”**](https://anzeljg.github.io/rin2/book2/2405/docs/tkinter/dimensions.html). Its **default value is 2 pixels**. |\n",
    "| bg | This option is used for the **background [**color**](https://anzeljg.github.io/rin2/book2/2405/docs/tkinter/colors.html)** of the widget |\n",
    "| bitmap | Name of one of the [**standard bitmaps**](https://anzeljg.github.io/rin2/book2/2405/docs/tkinter/bitmaps.html)to display on the button (instead of text). |\n",
    "| command | The command option is used to **set the function call** which is scheduled at the time when the function is called. |\n",
    "| cursor | This option is used to specify what type of [**cursor**](https://anzeljg.github.io/rin2/book2/2405/docs/tkinter/cursors.html) to show when the mouse is moved over the label. The default of this option is to use the standard cursor. |\n",
    "| default | tk.NORMAL is the default; use tk.DISABLED if the button is to be initially disabled (grayed out, unresponsive to mouse clicks). |\n",
    "| disabledforeground | Foreground [**color**](https://anzeljg.github.io/rin2/book2/2405/docs/tkinter/colors.html) of the button when it is disabled.|\n",

    "| font | This option specifies the **[font](https://tkdocs.com/shipman/fonts.html) type of text** inside the button. |\n",
    "| height | This option indicates the height of the widget. This height indicates the number of text lines in the case of text lines and it indicates the number of pixels in the case of images. |\n",
    "| image | This option indicates the [image](https://tkdocs.com/shipman/images.html) displayed on the button.|\n",
    "| high\n",
    "| justify | This option specifies the alignment of multiple lines in the label. The default value is CENTER. Other values are RIGHT, LEFT; you can justify according to your requirement |\n",
    "| padx | This option indicates the **horizontal padding of the text**. The default value of this option is 1. [**Section 5.1, “Dimensions”**](https://anzeljg.github.io/rin2/book2/2405/docs/tkinter/dimensions.html)|\n",
    "| pady | This option indicates the **vertical padding of the text**. The default value of this option is 1. [**Section 5.1, “Dimensions”**](https://anzeljg.github.io/rin2/book2/2405/docs/tkinter/dimensions.html)|\n",
    "| relief | This option indicates the **type of border ([relief style](https://anzeljg.github.io/rin2/book2/2405/docs/tkinter/relief.html))**. The default value of this option is FLAT |\n",
    "| repeatdelay | See repeatinterval, below. |\n",
    "| repeatinterval | Normally, a button fires only once when the user releases the mouse button. If you want the button to fire at regular intervals as long as the mouse button is held down, set this option to a number of milliseconds to be used between repeats, and set the repeatdelay to the number of milliseconds to wait before starting to repeat. For example, if you specify “repeatdelay=500, repeatinterval=100” the button will fire after half a second, and every tenth of a second thereafter, until the user releases the mouse button. If the user does not hold the mouse button down at least repeatdelay milliseconds, the button will fire normally. |\n",
    "| state | Set this option to tk.DISABLED to gray out the button and make it unresponsive. Has the value tk.ACTIVE when the mouse is over it. Default is tk.NORMAL. |\n",
    "| text | This option is set to the string variable and it may contain one or more than one line of text |\n",
    "| textvariable | This option is associated with a **Tkinter variable** that is (StringVar) with a label. If you change the value of this variable then **text inside the label gets updated**. |\n",
    "| underline | This option is used to underline a specific part of the text. The default value of this **option =-1(no underline)**; you can **set it to any integer value** up to n and counting starts from 0. For example, underline=1 would underline the second character of the button's text. |\n",
    "| width | This option indicates the width of the widget. |\n",
    "| wraplength | Rather than having only one line as the label text, you can just break it to any number of lines where each line has the number of characters specified to this option. |"
